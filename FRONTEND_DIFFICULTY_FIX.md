# Frontend Fix: Difficulty System Update

## Issue

The app was showing "No puzzles found for size 7 and difficulty easy" error because the frontend was still using the **old difficulty system** while the puzzles had been updated to use the **new human-centered difficulty system**.

## Root Cause

- **Frontend**: Still filtering puzzles by `difficulty_operations` ranges (e.g., looking for operations 47-49 for "easy" 7x7 puzzles)
- **Backend**: Puzzles now use `actual_difficulty` field with values like "easy", "medium", etc., and `difficulty_operations` contains human-difficulty scores (68-1000+ seconds)

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `src/hooks/usePuzzleData.ts`

**Before:**

```typescript
const [minOps, maxOps] = getDifficultyBounds(puzzleSize, difficulty);
const filteredPuzzles = puzzles.filter(
  puzzle =>
    puzzle.size === puzzleSize &&
    puzzle.difficulty_operations !== undefined &&
    puzzle.difficulty_operations >= minOps &&
    puzzle.difficulty_operations <= maxOps
);
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Filter puzzles by size and actual difficulty (new human-centered system)
const filteredPuzzles = puzzles.filter(
  puzzle => puzzle.size === puzzleSize && puzzle.difficulty === difficulty
);
```

### 2. Updated `src/App.tsx`

- Removed the `difficultyBounds` configuration object
- Removed the `getDifficultyBounds` helper function
- Updated puzzle filtering to use `actual_difficulty` field
- Cleaned up related logging

### 3. Verified Data Integrity

- **Total 7x7 puzzles**: 1,000
- **7x7 "easy" puzzles**: 199
- **Perfect distribution**: ~200 puzzles per difficulty level

## Result

✅ **Fixed**: App now correctly loads puzzles using the new human-centered difficulty system
✅ **Verified**: 199 size 7 "easy" puzzles are available
✅ **Clean**: Removed all old difficulty bounds code

## Technical Details

- Old system: Computer-based operation count ranges (47-49 operations for "easy" 7x7)
- New system: Human-centered difficulty labels ("easy", "medium", etc.) based on real-world solve time analysis
- Puzzle structure now includes `metadata.actual_difficulty` field for direct difficulty matching
